# Task From Scratch Implementation

This project involves creating a custom implementation of a Task from scratch. While the Task class already exists within the .NET runtime, this implementation is not required for utilizing **async** and **await** functionality. Instead, the purpose of this project is to understand how the Task works, how it is structured, and the underlying mechanisms behind its implementation.

This custom Task includes methods such as **.Run()**, **.Wait()**, **.ContinueWith()**, and even supports the use of the **await** keyword. By building the Task in this way, the project aims to provide hands-on experience with the inner workings and construction of these methods.
